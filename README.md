# Journey to Zen Mountain Monastery The Most Peaceful Place on Earth


**First, the only important message of this note,**

**I could not believe that you are in the hospital. I would have called every hospital in the area to find you...however I** ***did*** **get lucky. I found you on the first call. I would have contacted you sooner, but it was late when I got your message. Attached to this note is a small gift, a token to remind you that you are in my thoughts, every time you look at it remember that I am sending positive thoughts your way.**

**Get well soon!**

Second, of much less important, updates from my journey,

Knowing that hospitals have the potential to be very boring, I am writing this in as much detail as I can muster so that time might pass faster for you. This note isn’t edited, so bear that in mind whenever it rambles, goes on a tangent, or lacks coherence. 

Starting from the day I left…

I woke up early with a smile, happy to see the weather was cooperative. I wish I could say that I was fully ready to the point where I woke up, got on my bike, and left. But at this point I still had some loose ends to tie up. Mainly, packing my bags fully, and getting one or two items from the store. I was racing against the clock to get to the Port Jefferson-Bridgeport ferry on time. Without rushing, but with a hurry, I packed my bags, got the items I needed, and had enough time to bike the 12 mile route from my parents house to the ferry without any worry that I would miss it. Before I could go my mother and sister both felt it was necessary to have a proper goodbye, so I hugged them both, promised I would be careful, and took a photo of me and my bike -- fully loaded and ready to go. As I was leaving, my sister’s boyfriend volunteered to drive me to the port. I took him up on the offer, unloaded my bike into his Jeep Wrangler and away we went.

Fast forward through the ferry ride from Port Jeff to Bridgeport. I am now in Bridgeport, Connecticut, roughly 60 miles from Carmel, NY, where I would be staying for the night. It was a long 60 miles. Bridgeport is a lower-income area than Hauppauge, dilapidated, with boarded up homes and a lot of liquor stores. I passed through nervously. It wasn’t long until I reached the end of the area, no more than a few miles. After Bridgeport I soon found myself in a wealthier area of Connecticut, marked by big houses surrounded by privacy shrubs and distanced from the road by very long driveways. I do not know how long I was in this area, nor do I know the distance I traveled through it. But I do know I will seek another route if I ever need to make it to the ferry again. This area was *hilly*. I mean it. This whole trip has been through mountains and valleys, with plenty of ups and downs, but no hills or mountains since have been as steep as those from this first part of the journey. I huffed and puffed, breathing deep in and out through my nose, pushing one leg after another, left leg, right leg, repeat, for what felt like an eternity. I was passing these big houses, tucked away on mountainsides, accessible by only the steepest roads, and I wondered how many people actually come to visit. Even for a car, this area would not be very welcoming. I pushed though nonetheless, lucky that the day was overcast and therefore I did not sweat nor did I need to drink a lot of water. I just needed to persevere. My weeks of training came in handy on this day more than any other.

After the mountainous roads of Connecticut, I glided through the rest of the day. It took me from 11 AM arriving in Bridgeport to 5:30 PM arriving in Carmel. Upon arrival in Carmel I was surprised to see cars in the driveway of the house I was staying at. You see, when I made arrangements with Bryan, who was to be my host, he thought I would be arriving a day before I actually did. He told me that on the day of my arrival no one would be home. However, he and I worked it out where I could stay on the property. I thought, "WOW! A total stranger is letting me stay on his property, having never met me, having never seen my face, knowing only that I would have no place else to go if not for him! This is incredible!"

Well, when I arrived he was just leaving for the evening. We had a quick chat about cycling, he went inside grabbed his bags, and left me alone on the property to set up camp, relax for the evening, and prepare for the next day. Nice, right? Well, he was, it was, even nicer than that. Before leaving he _warmed up_ a **huge** piece of homemade apple pie, put it on a plate, and also grabbed a ripe banana, and handed both to me. I was in heaven at this point. He left and I promptly ate the apple pie and packed away the banana for the next day…

The next morning I packed up camp and biked to New Paltz, from Carmel to New Paltz is only 40 miles. It was a nice ride, much less mountainous than the previous day, and sunnier as well. Whereas the first day was fully overcast, with the sun hardly ever peeking out, the second day came complete with sun and shine. I made it to New Paltz without incident, stopping only once midway at a produce store in a small town to buy and eat some tangerines. I arrived in New Paltz and found the place I would be staying. It was a small house nearby the SUNY school where my host, Ali, is attending graduate school for electrical engineering. He was as welcoming as Bryan was and he and I have become good acquaintances since. That night he prepared an Iranian dish for us and two of his friends, Bing and Muhammed. How welcoming, generous, and warm a host was Ali? When it came time to sleep, he offered me his bed, while he himself would sleep on the wood floor. I mean, I couldn’t beleive it, again, I am a stranger to him, and he is cooking dinner, and offering me his bed to sleep in. (I should mention that after dinner he prepared tea then showed me around New Paltz and campus). I refused the bed and slept in my sleeping bag. The next morning we ate breakfast together and I went off to my third host, Douglas.
